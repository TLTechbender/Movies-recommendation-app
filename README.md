 ## HELP!!
Suggestions and improvements would mean a lot to me, feel free to pull the repo and make it even better.


## UPDATE ONE
### LESSONS LEARNED
* swiper.js is not comfortable with using css to specify it's width, it prefers the breakpoints specified in the js file
* The more I query the API the better I can account for unexpected errors and edge cases.
